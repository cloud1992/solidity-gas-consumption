## The objective of this repository is to compare gas consumption of different approaches to accomplishing the same task, aiming to enhance efficiency when writing Solidity code.



### Test
Each case study will have a contract with different functions and we will use a test script to compare gas.

To run any test in particular you can execute:
```shell
$ forge test --match-test test-name -vv
```
To run all test
```shell
$ forge test -vv
```
